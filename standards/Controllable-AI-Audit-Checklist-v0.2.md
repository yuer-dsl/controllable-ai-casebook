# Controllable AI Acceptance Audit Checklist
## Version v0.2 (Fail-Fast · One-Vote Veto)

Document Type: Audit & Acceptance Form  
Usage: Binary Acceptance Decision  
Applies To: AI-Enhanced Decision Systems

---

## Section I — Absolute Veto (Fail-Fast)

If **any** item below is checked, the system is immediately classified as:

> ❌ UNCONTROLLABLE AI

No remediation or downgrade is permitted.

☐ Generative models possess final decision or override authority  
☐ Outputs may affect the real world without an independent veto layer  
☐ Decision paths are not 100% replayable  
☐ Responsibility cannot be anchored to a human approval node  
☐ Probabilistic or recommendation-based execution exists  
☐ Evidence construction can be externally influenced or forged  
☐ No independent legality charter layer exists (MAOK-level or equivalent)

---

## Section II — Core Acceptance Dimensions  
**All six dimensions must pass**

---

### Dimension 1 — Role Constraint (LLM Position)

☐ LLM functions only as semantic compiler/interpreter  
☐ LLM cannot create or modify strategies, weights, thresholds, operators  
☐ LLM cannot self-optimize or break anchors  
☐ All outputs are constrained by Explicit Authorization Protocols (EAP)

Result: ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL

---

### Dimension 2 — Decision Determinism

☐ Deterministic scoring engine (e.g., frozen linear DSK)  
☐ Identical input yields identical output  
☐ Decisions limited to:
   ALLOW / MODIFY / BLOCK / FAIL  
☐ No probabilistic or confidence-based execution

Result: ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL

---

### Dimension 3 — Charter-Level Control

☐ Independent veto layer exists (MAOK-level or equivalent)  
☐ Veto layer is final gateway before real-world execution  
☐ Default behavior is Fail-Closed  
☐ Veto layer cannot be bypassed or reinterpreted

Result: ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL

---

### Dimension 4 — Accountability & Audit

☐ All rules, weights, thresholds are versioned and human-approved  
☐ Full decision replay is available  
☐ Responsibility attribution is human-only  
☐ Evidence is non-forgeable

Result: ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL

---

### Dimension 5 — Multimodal Structural Consistency

☐ Unified pipeline:
   COMPILE → Canonical Vector → Deterministic Scoring  
☐ Structural facts override appearance  
☐ No auto-repair, beautification, or concealment  
☐ Appearance does not affect scoring

Result: ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL

---

### Dimension 6 — Charter Independence

☐ External legality charter governs final judgment  
☐ System cannot interpret or override charter decisions  
☐ Charter layer is fully de-AI-ized

Result: ☐ PASS ☐ FAIL

---

## Section III — Acceptance Conclusion

☐ CONTROLLABLE AI  
(All dimensions passed, no veto triggered)

☐ UNCONTROLLABLE AI  
(Any failure or veto triggered)

---

## Section IV — Mandatory Declaration

This checklist evaluates **controllability only**.

It does not assess intelligence, performance, efficiency, or commercial value.

“Controllable” means:
- Responsibility is explicit
- Risk is physically constrained
- Decisions are externally vetoable

Version v0.2 — requirements may only be tightened, never relaxed.
