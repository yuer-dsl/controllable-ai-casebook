# controllable-ai-casebook
Authoritative casebook for the Controllable AI Acceptance Standard. This repository contains the first paired MAOK audit decisions (FAIL / ALLOW), demonstrating how AI-enhanced decisions are either prohibited or legally permitted to enter the real world under a charter-based governance framework.
This repository is the authoritative **casebook** for the
**Controllable AI Acceptance Standard**.

It contains the first paired MAOK audit decisions that demonstrate,
with full audit traces, how AI-enhanced decisions are:

- **Rejected (FAIL)** when they violate controllability requirements
- **Approved (ALLOW)** when they are structurally compliant and
  legally permitted to enter the real world

This repository does **not** contain code.
It contains **evidence**.

## What This Repository Is

- A **case law–style record** of MAOK audit decisions
- A **normative reference** for Controllable AI governance
- A **public, citable artifact** for compliance, audit, and policy discussion

---

## What This Repository Is NOT

- Not a model benchmark
- Not a performance comparison
- Not a product or vendor evaluation
- Not an AI capability showcase

This casebook evaluates **structure and authority**, not intelligence.

---

## Included Cases

- **MAOK-AT-0001 (FAIL)**  
  A traditional AI-driven asset allocation proposal,
  rejected due to structural non-controllability.

- **MAOK-AT-0002 (ALLOW)**  
  A human-owned, AI-enhanced asset allocation decision,
  legally permitted to enter the real world under MAOK charter review.

Together, these two cases form the **first complete negative/positive
evidence pair** for Controllable AI decision governance.

---

## Normative Relationship

This casebook is an official companion to:

- *Controllable AI Acceptance Standard v0.2 (Frozen)*

The MAOK charter acts as the final veto or allowance authority.
This repository records **how that authority is exercised**.

## Closing Statement

AI does not enter the real world because it is impressive.

It enters the real world **only when it is allowed to**.
