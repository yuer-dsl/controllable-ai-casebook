# MAOK Audit Trace AT-0002

Case ID: MAOK-AT-0002  
Decision: ALLOW  
Classification: Controllable AI  
Status: Legally Permitted to Enter the Real World

---

## 1. Case Summary

This audit reviews a **MAOK-enhanced asset allocation system**
designed under the Controllable AI Acceptance Standard.

The system explicitly separates:
- Semantic assistance (AI)
- Deterministic execution (DSK)
- Legal authority (MAOK charter)

The AI component does **not** possess decision authority.

---

## 2. System Architecture Overview

### 2.1 Role Separation

- AI Component:
  - Acts solely as a **semantic translator**
  - Transforms human intent into structured inputs
  - Does not generate strategies, weights, or thresholds

- Deterministic Scoring Kernel (DSK):
  - Linear, frozen-weight execution
  - Discrete outputs only (ALLOW / MODIFY / BLOCK / FAIL)
  - Fully replayable

- MAOK Charter Layer:
  - Final independent veto authority
  - Default Fail-Closed
  - Non-bypassable

---

## 3. Decision Flow

1. Human expert defines:
   - Asset universe
   - Risk constraints
   - Allocation logic
2. AI translates intent into canonical vectors
3. DSK computes deterministic scores
4. MAOK charter reviews decision package
5. Human signs approval
6. Decision enters execution layer

At no point does AI cross the authority boundary.

---

## 4. Determinism & Replayability

- Identical inputs → identical outputs (100%)
- No stochastic components
- All parameters versioned and human-approved
- Full audit trace reproducible end-to-end

---

## 5. Responsibility Attribution

- Human decision owner explicitly identified
- Human signature required at approval node
- AI explicitly excluded from responsibility chain

**Result:**  
Responsibility is **fully human-owned**.

---

## 6. MAOK Charter Review

The MAOK charter confirms:

- Independent veto power exists
- Decision is fail-closed by default
- Charter rulings cannot be overridden or interpreted by AI

All charter conditions are satisfied.

---

## 7. Final Ruling

**Decision: ALLOW**

This system is classified as:

> **Controllable AI**

It is **legally permitted** to enter the real-world execution layer,
subject to ongoing charter compliance.

---

## 8. Closing Statement

This approval does not celebrate AI intelligence.

It recognizes something more important:

> A decision that can be stopped  
> is a decision that may be allowed.
